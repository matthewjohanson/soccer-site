    <h1>5 Drills Every U12 Coach Should Know</h1>
    <p><strong>By Coach Matt</strong></p>
    <p>Getting your players excited about practice starts with drills that are fun and game-like. Here are five that work every time with U10 and U12 players.</p>

    <h2>1. Triangle Passing</h2>
    <p>Set up a triangle with cones. Players pass and move to a new cone. This teaches spacing and timing.</p>

    <h2>2. 4v1 Rondo</h2>
    <p>Four players form a square and one goes in the middle. The goal is quick passing to keep possession. Great for reaction time and communication.</p>

    <h2>3. Cone Gate Dribbling</h2>
    <p>Scatter cones in pairs to form gates. Players dribble through as many gates as possible in 30 seconds. It improves ball control under pressure.</p>

    <h2>4. Quick Turns Challenge</h2>
    <p>Set up four stations where players must perform a turn (Cruyff, drag back, inside hook, etc.). Time them and encourage improvement each round.</p>

    <h2>5. 3v3 to Goal</h2>
    <p>Small-sided games encourage decision-making. Keep it fast and fun with rotating teams or "winner stays on."</p>

    <h2>Recommended Gear</h2>
